Known limitations
-----------------
- unsigned long long type not handled
- functions with variable number of arguments not handled
- goto statements not handled
- simplifies &(*ptr) into ptr. When ptr is out of bounds, error will be missed.
- largest size of array handled is 1073741823/8
- every function prototype (or body) needs to be defined before the call
- unstructured switch not handled

C subset handled
