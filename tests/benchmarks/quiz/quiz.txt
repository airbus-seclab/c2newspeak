Static analyzers quiz

scope
022: non-initialized pointer deref
011: array of pointers
023: invalid pointer arithmetic (on variable)
012: pointer arithmetic (on array)
010: function pointer
014: deallocation
015: union (and pointers)
033: signed/unsigned integer overflow
034: char integer overflow
035: greater than with strange implicit cast

soundness of C model
036: initialization in C (I don't know what to think)
026: cast between integer and pointer
004: initialisation of a pointer as a sequence of 4 bytes of value 0
005: same as 004, but more in the memcpy style (soundness)
007: same as 005, but precision version
006: partial copy (1 byte) (could happen with off-by-ones)
018: memcpy over structures of pointers (soundness)
009: pointer arithmetic and cross field boundaries
000: offsetof
001: invalid offsetof

precision
037: simple do while
027: memset 0 with off by one (should put a simplified version in base)
020: simple test with != guard (instead of <), not good for widening
002: random pointer (from an uninitialized int, to mimic from the outside of the program) and comparison with a known pointer before deref
013: pointer arithmetic (with loop, similar to 012)
016: strings with some 0
003: relation between error code and initialized index (maybe not put in base)
025: similar to 003, but with use (maybe remove 003)
028: similar to 025, but with error
032: precision on structure of function pointer
029: function pointer
030: variation on 029
031: variation on 029
