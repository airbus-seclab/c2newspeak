Static analyzers quiz

scope
char integer overflow
signed/unsigned integer overflow
greater than with strange implicit cast
non-initialized pointer deref
array of pointers
invalid pointer arithmetic (on variable)
pointer arithmetic (on array)
union (and pointers)
function pointer
deallocation

soundness of C model
memset 0 with off by one (should put a simplified version in base)??
initialisation of a pointer as a sequence of 4 bytes of value 0
same as 004, but more in the memcpy style (soundness)
same as 005, but precision version
partial copy (1 byte) (could happen with off-by-ones)
memcpy over structures of pointers (soundness)
pointer arithmetic and cross field boundaries
offsetof
invalid offsetof
initialization in C (I don't know what to think)

precision
simple do while
simple test with != guard (instead of <), not good for widening
random pointer (from an uninitialized int, to mimic from the outside of the program) and comparison with a known pointer before deref
pointer arithmetic (with loop, similar to 012)
cast between integer and pointer
strings with some 0
similar to 003, but with use (maybe remove 003)
precision on structure of function pointer
function pointer
variation on previous one
