// There is much more! Feel free to experiment and let us know your thoughts.

// This is a placeholder for your own non-regression test.
// 1) write your code
// 2) add 012 to TESTS in Makefile
// 3) run make 012.spec to generate the output
// 4) run make 012 to check the output (for instance, after you have modified 
// c2newspeak source code)

// You can optionally add parameters to pass to c2newspeak in a file 012.in
