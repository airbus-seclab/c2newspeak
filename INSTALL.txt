C2Newspeak is a library to compile C to the intermediate language Newspeak.
Newspeak is designed for the purpose of static analysis.

- CIL 1.3.5 (not the last one 1.3.6 !) should be installed
- An environment variable CIL should be defined with the path of CIL library.
  (cil/obj/x86_LINUX or cil/obj/x86_WIN32)
- Then, do:
    make install
  This will compile and copy to the directory /bin the files:
    c2newspeak		     C2Newspeak executable
    newspeak.ml		     newspeak implementation
    newspeak.mli	     newspeak interface
    npkstats		     Npkstats executable

- To compile to newspeak, use c2newspeak
- To read newspeak files in your own project, use newspeak.ml and newspeak.mli
- Npkstats is a small utilitary to compute statistics of C programs that uses
  newspeak. It is also an example that shows how to use newspeak.
