C2Newspeak is a library to compile C to the intermediate language Newspeak.
Newspeak is designed for the purpose of static analysis.

- Do:
    make
  This will compile and copy to the bin/ directory the files:
    newspeak.cmi	     newspeak compiled interface
    newspeak.cma	     newspeak library for caml bytecode compiler
    newspeak.a newspeak.cmxa newspeak library for caml native-code compiler
    c2newspeak		     compiler from C to Newspeak
    npkstats		     statistics on Newspeak files
    npkstrip		     removes all functions not called from main
    npksimplify		     performs some newspeak simplifications

  This will produce the documentation in html in the doc/ directory. 
  The documentation index file is index.html.

- To compile a C file to Newspeak, use c2newspeak
- To read and manipulate Newspeak files in your own project, use the libraries 
  newspeak.cma (for bytecode) 
  or newspeak.a and newspeak.cmxa (for native-code). (Note that newspeak.cmxa
  needs the standard ocaml nums.cmxa)
- Please refer to the documentation doc/index.html.
