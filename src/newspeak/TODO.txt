C syntax
--------
- look at the possibility to do with the if/then/else as in the switch
- volatile attribute: add flag.  see tests/missing/volatile.c
- const attribute as a flag? impossible for CIL local consts.
  Only for const strings? see tests/missing/const4.c
- cast int <-> enum: more precise ?
- handle bitfields? see tests/missing/bitfield.c

Kernel
------
- for merging different files two solutions:
  Mergecil puis Cil2kernel ou Cil2kernel puis Mergekernel (compile / link)
- merge: beware of extern storage?
- Goto in Ifs -> document ml and mli and send a mail to sourceforge
- sizeof(void)
- cast from pointer to (int) and addition of integer same as addition of
  pointers in two-complement...
- handle error when function main not defined (in kernelmerge ?)
- Problem of architecture dependent data. They are currently located in
  Cilutils (sizeof* and offsetof). Think about another solution ?
- Document the fact that all pointer comparisons are cast into uint
  comparisons by CIL (Eq and Ne are arithmetic binary ops)
- Write an interpreter. The simplest way would be to use the analyser
  structure and change the abstract semantics to the concrete one
- Write correctly the formalism of cil2kernel
- Add some tests about TNamed types
