(** Newspeak is a language designed for the purpose of static analysis. 
    It was designed with these features in mind:
    - precise: its semantics is precisely defined, 
    (see {e Newspeak, Doubleplussimple Minilang for Goodthinkful Static 
    Analysis of C} for a thorough and formal description. Available from
    {{:http://www.penjili.org}www.penjili.org})
    - simple: its primitives are as few, as standard and as concise as 
    possible,
    - minimal: no language primitive or fragment of primitive should be 
    expressible as a combination of other primitives,
    - explicit: primitives are context-free, i.e. all semantic information
    needed to execute it are readily available,
    - analysis-friendly: annotations useless for execution are added to allow
    a static analysis tool to perform correctness checks,
    - architecture-independent: all architecture or compiler dependent features
    (size of types, offsets of structure fields, order of executions, ...)
    are made explicit byt the translation to Newspeak,
    - expressive: it should be possible to translate most C programs into 
    Newspeak.

    Newspeak can be seen as a kind of high-level assembly language with 
    annotations for analysis.
    The type of Newspeak programs, types, statements and expressions are 
    described in this module.
    Additionnally, some functions to create, manipulate, export and display 
    Newspeak programs are provided.
